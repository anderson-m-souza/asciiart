# asciiart

This is my implementation of a program to turn images into ASCII-art, as suggested at the "Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners" series by Robert Heaton.

To run this program you need to install the Python libraries [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/), [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/), [FPDF](https://pyfpdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and [uvccapture](https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/uvccapture/uvccapture.1.en.html)

The options available are:
- Brightness mode
- Max width
- Color
- Invert color
- Repeat characteres
- Character manp
- Input from webcam
- Paint characteres
- Input from image
- Output to pdf
